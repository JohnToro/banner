<p>The Banner Plugin allows you to create and display banner ads.  Banners may be displayed within the header and footer templates, as well
as in blocks, stories, and static pages.</p>
<p>This version requires GLFusion 1.1.0 or higher.</p>

The plugin has no way of knowing whether template variables are actually defined, so it counts each attempt to display an ad whether it is actually displayed or not.</td>
