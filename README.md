banner
======

The Banner plugin for glFusion allows site administrators to display
banner ads in the header, footer, or blocks on their site.

*********************************************************
This plugin is based on the Banner Plugin for Geeklog:

Auther: hiroshi sakuramoto    hiroron AT hiroron DOT com
Presented by:Ivy komma AT ivywe DOT co DOT jp

... which, in turn, is based on the Geeklog Links plugin.

The original README_jp.txt file has been removed since it is no longer
accurate.  If someone would like to submit a translation of this file 
to Japanese, that would be welcome.
*********************************************************

This is an early test release, and is not intended for use on production
sites.  The documentation is a work in progress and can currently be seen
at http://www.leegarner.com/dokuwiki/doku.php/glfusion:glbanner:start.

Suggesions are welcome.
